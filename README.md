# JerseyShop
### Author

### Overview
It is a simple shopping site based on react and react-redux that I learned from last few weeks. Customer could add selected items to cart, edit cart, input billing and shipping information and place order.

### Details
1. Customer could click add to cart to add items and the number at top right corner will show the items quantity in cart
2. Customer could click MyCart to open the cart page. In this page, customer could delete selected items or editing the item quantity. Customer also could apply a coupon code if the order is qualified. 
3. At cart page, Customer could click checkout button to the checkout page. In this page, customer could input billing and shipping information and place the order. After placing order, a confirmation and thank you information will displayed. 

### Technologies
React, React-redux, html, CSS

### Future Improvement Ideas
1. BIlling and shipping input validation
2. More CSS work
3. Single detail page for each merchandise
4. Custom Jersey (name and number print) function
5. Generate order number and provide order status checking


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
